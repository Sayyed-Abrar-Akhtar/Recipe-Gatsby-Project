            <p>
              How lucky we are today â€“ all delicious food is easily available to
              us! Sometimes, I wonder how life was in the ancient past when our
              ancestors did not have easy access to food which we have today.

              Want to try out the Chinese food? No need to go to China! Just
              visit any restaurant in the city and get familiar with these hot
              and salty tastes.
