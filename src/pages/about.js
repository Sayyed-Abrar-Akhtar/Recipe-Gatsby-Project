            <p>
              How lucky we are today â€“ all delicious food is easily available to
              us! Sometimes, I wonder how life was in the ancient past when our
              ancestors did not have easy access to food which we have today.

            <p>
              Want to try out the Chinese food? No need to go to China! Just
              visit any restaurant in the city and get familiar with these hot
              and salty tastes.
